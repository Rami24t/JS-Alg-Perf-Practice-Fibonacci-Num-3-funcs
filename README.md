3 Fibonacci num functions + perf testing in js

Given a fibonacci number finder method, I coded two new methods/algs (in two other objects)
that are of significantly improved performance over the given method.

This is my solution to a challenge exercise I found on codewars.

The challenge was to code a better performing function than a fibonacci number finder method that they provided. 

I wrote two better performing methods as a solution to the challenge.

An example of the performance of the different methods when called 33 times to find the first 33 fibonacci numbers is:

Method/alg provided by challenge needed about 135 milliseconds.

First solution method/alg took about: 14 milliseconds.
Second solution method/alg took about: 15 milliseconds.

Which shows that my functions were about 9 times more more efficient when called 33 times to calculate and return the first 33 fibonacci numbers. 

Another performance example when calling the mothods 44 times to calculate all the fibonacci numbers up to the 44th one(433494437):

The provided method took about: 18000-18750 milliseconds.
While my solution methods/algs took about 18-21 milliseconds.

Which is about an 940x times improvement in performance over the method given in their challenge.
And so, this challenge of implementing (a) better performing method/algorithm(s) is tackled/solved.
