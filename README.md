# JS-Alg-Perf-Practice-Fibonacci-Num-3-funcs
3 Fibonacci num functions + perf testing in js

Given a fibonacci number finder method, I coded two new methods/algs (in two other objects)
that are of significantly improved performance over the given method.

This is my solution to a challenge exercise I found on codewars.

The challenge was to code a better performing function than a fibonacci number finder method that they provided. 

I wrote two better performing methods as a solution to the challenge.

An example of the performance of the different methods when called 33 times to find the first 33 fibonacci numbers is:

Method/alg provided by challenge needed about 135 milliseconds.

First solution method/alg took about: 14 milliseconds.
Second solution method/alg took about: 15 milliseconds.

Which shows that my functions were about 9 times more more efficient when called 33 times to calculate and return the first 33 fibonacci numbers. And thus the problem of making better algorithms was solved.
